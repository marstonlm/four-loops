        <h3>About A4Loop</h3>
        <p>19 Jan 2038 at 3:14:07 AM (End of the word according to Unix–2^32 seconds after January 1, 1970) That’s what’s cool about working with computers. They don’t argue, they remember everything, and they don’t drink all your beer. (Paul Leary) PHP is a minor evil perpetrated and created by incompetent amateurs, whereas Perl is a great and insidious evil perpetrated by skilled but perverted professionals. (Jon Ribbens) The bulk of all patents are crap. Spending time reading them is stupid. It’s up to the patent owner to do so, and to enforce them. (Linus Torvalds) If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in. (Edsger Dijkstra)<br>

          It would appear that we have reached the limits of what it is possible to achieve with computer technology, although one should be careful with such statements, as they tend to sound pretty silly in 5 years. (John Von Neumann, circa 1949) I’ve finally learned what ‘upward compatible’ means. It means we get to keep all our old mistakes. (Dennie van Tassel) The city’s central computer told you? R2D2, you know better than to trust a strange computer! (C3PO) Windows NT addresses 2 Gigabytes of RAM, which is more than any application will ever need. (Microsoft, on the development of Windows NT, 1992) That’s the thing about people who think they hate computers. What they really hate is lousy programmers. (Larry Niven)</p>
